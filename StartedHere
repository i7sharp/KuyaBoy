It is 8:36pm and trying to figure out what I am doing or getting into.
Let me write some things worth remembering: i7, barangays, Needs Assessments (Samuel B. McClelland), Philippines, Puerto Princesa, 
"Ang Barangay ni Kuya Boy," "Ating Barangay," best barangay websites, codes/coding, ...
That's it for now. Thank you for reading this. :)
